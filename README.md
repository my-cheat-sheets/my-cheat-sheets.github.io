## Setup

### Contact Form Setup

The contact form uses [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com) for secure, serverless form submissions:

1. Visit [https://web3forms.com](https://web3forms.com)
2. Enter your email address to receive form submissions
3. Copy your free access key
4. Open `index.html` and replace `YOUR_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY` with your actual access key (line ~285)

The form is secure, spam-protected, and works perfectly with static sites like GitHub Pages.

## Preview Locally

1. Open `index.html` directly in browser, or
2. Run a local server: `python -m http.server 8000`
